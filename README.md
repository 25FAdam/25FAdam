## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a double M.Sc. in Data Science through the EIT Digital Master School, with my first year at UPM in Madrid ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ and my second at ELTE in Budapest ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡º. My passion lies at the intersection of data, AI, and digital innovation - turning raw information into impactful solutions.

Curious what happens when curiosity meets code? Scroll down and check out some of the projects Iâ€™ve been tangled up in.

PS: no buzzwords were harmed in the making.
